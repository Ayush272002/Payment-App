Note - The server is deployed on free tier so it might take time to get responses from the server when you test this application. Or if you want to run it locally then follow the instructions below. 

- Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ayush272002/Payment-App
```

There is a docker file to easily run the project easily

Steps to do that 

- Go to the `docker-compose.yml` and fill `MONGODB_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`.
- Open your terminal in the root dir of the project then run
- ```shell
    docker-compose up
    ```
- Go to `http://localhost:5173` on your browser <br>
The project would have been hosted there 

Alternatively,

- Backend <br>
Run the following command from the project root directory. 

```shell
docker pull ayush27002/payment-app:backend
docker run -e MONGODB_URL=<your_mongo_url> -e PORT=8000 -e JWT_SECRET=<jwt_pass> -d -p 8000:8000 ayush27002/payment-app:backend
```

- Frontend <br>

```

***Imp -> Why Do I dont need to use networks and the frontend and backend run without networks <br><br>
Ans -> In a web application running in a browser, localhost always refers to the machine running the browser, not the container. so it makes request to localhost which is the machine and not the container anymore***
